# how to...?


once upon a time, i had an anxiety dream about addressing an envelope in cursive. i couldn't remember how to write the letter combination of 'r' and 'i'. then i went down a dream rabbit hole about the perfect website to look up letter combos in different cursive hands. in honor of that extremely nerdy dream digression that meant i actually went back to sleep eventually, this now exists.


## what do?

### communicate what letter you're saying (aka phonetic alphabets)


### write cursive letter combinations

## how do?

this is a test-bed for me to play around with some technology and tooling that's newer for me.
